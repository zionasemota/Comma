# Comma
Comma is an iOS Mobile app used in tackling period poverty and limited access to period education. This project was inspired through hearing stories of my family members struggles in receiving/knowing how to manage their period and get access to the right products. I submitted this for a hackathon and was named a Quarterfinalist.
